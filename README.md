# NAMqtl
This directory contains scripts that were used to produce a linkage map of 2536 SNP markers in the maize population B73 x CML52.
Also included are scripts for analyzing quantitative trait loci for tarspot (Phyllachora maydis) resistance in this population.
The source data came from a public repository at /iplant/home/shared/panzea/genotypes/HapMap/v2/ at data.cyverse.org .  The perl 
scripts were made executable (chmod 755).  The R scripts were run in an Rscript command.
